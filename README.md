## 🌐 GramConnect

GramConnect is a community-focused web application designed to bridge the communication gap between **village residents and local authorities**.  
The platform enables people from rural areas to **raise complaints and report local issues** such as road damage, water supply problems, sanitation, electricity faults, or public safety concerns.

Once a complaint is submitted, **authorized officials can view, track, and respond** to these issues through a centralized dashboard. This ensures transparency, faster resolution, and better accountability in addressing grassroots-level problems.

GramConnect aims to **empower rural communities**, provide a digital voice to villagers, and support officials in delivering timely and effective solutions using modern web technologies.

## 💡 Idea Behind the Project

The idea behind **GramConnect** comes from a common issue faced in many village and rural areas — the **absence of a structured, transparent, and reliable system for reporting local problems**.

In traditional setups, villagers usually report issues such as damaged roads, water supply problems, electricity failures, sanitation concerns, or public safety issues by verbally informing local authorities. These complaints are often **not recorded properly**, leading to delays, lack of follow-up, or complete negligence.

GramConnect addresses this gap by providing a **digital complaint management platform** where villagers can easily submit complaints online. Each complaint is **stored, tracked, and monitored**, allowing officials to view reported issues, update their status, and take necessary action.

The core objective of this project is to **empower rural citizens with a digital voice**, improve transparency in governance, and help officials resolve community issues in a more organized and efficient manner using modern web technologies.

## 👥 User Roles & Responsibilities

GramConnect supports two primary user roles: **Villagers (People)** and **Officials**.  
Each role has specific permissions to ensure smooth communication and efficient issue resolution.
